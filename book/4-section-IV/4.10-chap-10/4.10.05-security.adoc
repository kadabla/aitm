A measure of systemâ€™s ability to resist unauthorized attempts at usage or behavior modification, while still providing service to legitimate users.

[quote, Shon Harris, Guide to the CISSP]
In reality, organizations have many other things to do than practice security.

You have been practicing security since you first selected your initial choice of development platform in Chapter 2. But by now, your security capability is a well-established organization with processes spanning the enterprise, and a cross-functional steering committee composed of senior executives and with direct access to Board governance channels.

Security is a significant and well-known domain in and of itself. Ultimately, however, *security is an _application_ of the governance principles discussed in the previous sections*. Deriving ultimately from the stakeholder's desire to sustain and protect the enterprise, security relies on

* accurate xref:risk-management[risk]
 assessment,
* a clear xref:controls[controls] strategy, and
* effective xref:assurance[assurance] practices (e.g. security xref:audit[audits]).

So what distinguishes security from more general concepts of risk? The definition at the top of this chapter section is a good start, with its mention of "unauthorized attempts" to access or modify systems. The above graphic uses the term "sanctionable," meaning violations might lead to legal or at least organizational penalties.

Many risks might involve carelessness, or incompetence, or random technical failure, or accidents of nature. They might even involve fraud or misrepresentation. But security focuses on violations (primarily intentional, but also unintentional) of policies protecting organizational assets. In fact, "Assets Protection" is a common alternate name for corporate security.

"Authorization" is a key concept. Given some valuable resource, is access restricted to those who ought to have it? Are they who they say they are? Do they have the right to access what they claim is theirs? Are they conducting themselves in an expected and approved manner?

The security mentality is very different from the  mentality found in a startup. A military analogy might be helpful. Being in a startup is like engaging in missions: search, extract, destroy, etc. One travels to a destination and operates with a single-point focus on completion.

Security on the other hand is like defending a perimeter. You have to think broadly across a large area, assessing weaknesses and distributing limited resources where they will have the greatest effect.

This is where a systematic approach, including an accepted set of terminology, becomes key. The CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional) guide proposes the following taxonomy:

* Vulnerability
* Threat agent
* Threat
* Risk
* Control
* Exposure
* Safeguard (e.g. control or enabler)

These terms are best understood in terms of their relationships, which are graphically illustrated in the diagram below:

image::images/4.10-security-taxonomy.png[]

(similar to <<Harris2013>>, p. 27.)

In implementing controls, the primary principles are:

* Availability. The asset must be accessible to those entitled to it.
* Integrity. The asset must be protected from destruction or corruption.
* Confidentiality. The asset must not be accessible to those not entitled to it.

===== Information classification
[quote, ISACA, Cobit 5 for Security]
At a time when the significance of information and related technologies is increasing in every aspect of business and public life, the need to mitigate information risk, which includes protecting information and related IT assets from ever-changing threats, is constantly intensifying.

Before we turn to security engineering and security operations, we need to understand the business context of security. The assets at risk are an important factor, and risk management gives us a good general framework. One additional technique associated with security is information classification. A basic hierarchy is often used, such as:

* Public
* Internal
* Confidential
* Restricted

The military uses the well known levels of:

* Unclassified
* Confidential
* Secret
* Top Secret

These classifications assist in establishing the security risk and necessary controls for a given digital system and/or process.

Information also can be categorized by subject area. This becomes important from a compliance point of view. This will be discussed in Chapter 11, in the chapter section on Records Management.

===== Security engineering
For the next two sections, we will adopt a "2-axis" view, first proposed in <<Betz2011a>>.

In this model, the systems lifecycle is considered along the horizontal access, and the user experience is considered along the vertical access (which also maps to the "stack.") In the following picture, we see the distinct concerns of the various stakeholders in the dual-axis model:

image::images/4.10-2axis-security.png[]

Security engineering is concerned with the fundamental security capabilities of the system, as well as ensuring that any initial principles established for the system are adhered to as development proceeds, and/or as vendors are selected and perhaps replaced over time.

====== Security architecture

There are multitudes of books written on security from an architecture and development perspective. The tools, techniques, and capabilities evolve quickly every year, which is why having a fundamental business understanding based in a stable framework of risk and control is essential.

We are not covering technical details, any more than we are covering specific programming languages or distributed systems engineering specifics - this is practice, not management. Studying for the Certified Information Systems Security Professional exam will provide both an understanding of security management, as well as current technical topics. A glance at the CISSP guide shows how involved such topics can be:

* The Harrison-Rizzo-Ullman security model
* The Diffie-Hellman Asymmetrical Encryption Algorithm
* Functions and Protocols in the OSI Model

Again, the issue is mapping such technical topics to the fundamentals of risk and control. Key topics we note here include:

* Authentication & authorization
* Network security
* Cryptography

*Authentication and authorization* are the cornerstones of *access*, i.e. the gateway to the asset. *Authentication* confirms that a person is who they say they are. *Authorization* is the management of their access rights (can they see the payroll? reset others' passwords?)

*Network security* is a complex sub-domain in and of itself. Because attacks typically transpire over the Internet and/or internal organizational networks, the structure and capabilities of networks are of critical concern, including topics such as:

* Routing
* Firewalls
* the Domain Name Service

Finally, *cryptography* is the "storage and transmission of data in a form that only those it is intended for can read and process" <<Harris2013>>.

All of these topics, and many more, require in depth study and staff development. At this writing, there is a notable shortage of skilled security professionals. Therefore, a critical risk is that your organization might not be able to hire people with the needed skills (consider our section on xref:resource-mgmt[resource management])

====== Security and SDLC
Security is a concern throughout the application lifecycle. You already know this, otherwise you would not have reached enterprise scale. But now you need to formalize it with some consistency, as that is what regulators and auditors expect, and it also makes it easier for your staff to work on various systems.

Security should be considered throughout the SDLC, including systems design, but this is easier said than done. Organizations will always be more interested in a system's functionality than its security. However, a security breach can ruin a company.

The CISSP recommends (among other topics) consideration of the following throughout the systems lifecycle:

* The role of environmental (e.g. operating system-level) safeguards versus internal application controls
* The challenges of testing
* Default implementation issues
* Ongoing monitoring

Increasingly important controls during the construction process in particular are:

* Code reviews
* Automated code analysis

We will discuss the Netflix Simian Army -- an important automated tool that can serve as a control -- in the next chapter section.

====== Sourcing and security

Vendors come and go in the digital marketplace, offering thousands of software-based products across every domain of interest (we call this the xref:tech-prod-lifecycle[technology product lifecycle]). Inevitably, these products have security errors. A vendor may issue a "patch" for such an error, which must be applied to all instances of the running software. Such patches are not without risk, and may break existing systems; they therefore require testing under conditions of urgency.

Increasingly, software is offered as a service, in which case it is the vendor responsibility to patch their own code. But what if they are slow to do this? Any customer relying on their service is running risk, and other controls may be required to mitigate the exposure.

One important source of vulnerabilities is the https://nvd.nist.gov/[National Vulnerability Database] supported by the National Institute for Standards and Technology. In this database, you can look up various products and see if they have known security holes. There are many cautions and nuances to using the NVD and it is not something to casually embrace, but it does represent an important, free, taxpayer-supported resource of use to security managers.

An important type of vulnerability is the "zero-day" vulnerability. With this kind of vulnerability, knowledge of a security "hole" becomes widespread before any patches are available (i.e., the software's author and users have "zero days" to create and deploy a fix). Zero-day exploits require fast and aggressive application of alternate controls, which leads us to the topic of security operations.

===== Security operations
Security requires ongoing operational attention. Security operations is first and foremost a form of operations, as discussed in xref:ops-mgmt[Chapter 6]. It requires on-duty and on-call personnel, and some physical or virtual point of shared awareness (for example, a physical Security Operations Center, perhaps co-located with a Network Operations Center).
