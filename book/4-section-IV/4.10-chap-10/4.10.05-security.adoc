A measure of systemâ€™s ability to resist unauthorized attempts at usage or behavior modification, while still providing service to legitimate users.

[quote, Shon Harris, Guide to the CISSP]
In reality, organizations have many other things to do than practice security.

You have been practicing security since you first selected your initial choice of development platform in Chapter 2. But by now, your security capability is a well-established organization with processes spanning the enterprise, and a cross-functional steering committee composed of senior executives and with direct access to Board governance channels.

Security is a significant and well-known domain in and of itself. Ultimately, however, *security is an _application_ of the governance principles discussed in the previous sections*. Deriving ultimately from the stakeholder's desire to sustain and protect the enterprise, security relies on

* accurate xref:risk-management[risk]
 assessment,
* a clear xref:controls[controls] strategy, and
* effective xref:assurance[assurance] practices (e.g. security xref:audit[audits]).

In fact, some of the previous material on controls was informed by the CISSP guide, because the concepts are generally applicable to risk management, not only security risks.

So what distinguishes security from more general concepts of risk? The definition at the top of this chapter section is a good start, with its mention of "unauthorized attempts" to access or modify systems. The above graphic uses the term "sanctionable," meaning violations might lead to legal or at least organizational penalties.

Many risks might involve carelessness, or incompetence, or random technical failure, or accidents of nature. They might even involve fraud or misrepresentation. But security focuses primarily on violations (primarily intentional, but also unintentional) of policies protecting organizational assets. In fact, "Assets Protection" is a common alternate name for corporate security.

"Authorization" is a key concept. Given some valuable resource, is access restricted to those who ought to have it? Are they who they say they are? Do they have the right to access what they claim is theirs? Are they conducting themselves in an expected and approved manner?

The security mentality is very different from the  mentality found in a startup. A military analogy might be helpful. Being in a startup is like engaging in missions: search, extract, destroy, etc. One travels to a destination and operates with a single-point focus on completion.

Security on the other hand is like defending a perimeter. You have to think broadly across a large area, assessing weaknesses and distributing limited resources where they will have the greatest effect.

This is where a systematic approach, including an accepted set of terminology, becomes key. The CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional) guide proposes the following taxonomy:

* Vulnerability
* Threat agent
* Threat
* Risk
* Control
* Exposure
* Safeguard (e.g. control or enabler)

These terms are best understood in terms of their relationships, which are graphically illustrated in the diagram below:

===== Information classification
[quote, ISACA, Cobit 5 for Security]
At a time when the significance of information and related technologies is increasing in every aspect of business and public life, the need to mitigate information risk, which includes protecting information and related IT assets from ever-changing threats, is constantly intensifying.
