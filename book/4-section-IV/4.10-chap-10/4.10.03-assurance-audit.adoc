===== Assurance

[quote, Russian proverb]
Trust, but verify.

Assurance is a broad term. In this book, it is associated with governance. It represents a form of additional confirmation that management is performing its tasks adequately.

Go back to the xref:gov-shop-example[example] that started the chapter, of the shop owner hiring a manager. Suppose that this relationship has continued for some time, and while things seem to be working OK, the owner has doubts about the arrangement.

Over time, things have gone well enough that the owner does not worry about the shop being opened on time, having sufficient stock, or paying suppliers. But are any number of doubts the owner might retain:

* Is money being accounted for honestly and accurately?
* Is the shop clean? Is it following local regulations? For example, fire, health and safety codes?
* If the manager selects a new supplier, are they trustworthy? Or is the shop at risk of selling counterfeit or tainted merchandise?
* Are the shop's prices competitive? Is it still well regarded in the community? Or has its reputation declined with the new manager?
* Is the shop protected from theft and disaster?

These kinds of concerns remain with the owner, by and large, even with a reliable and trustworthy manager. If not handled correctly, the owner's entire investment is at risk. The manager may only have a salary (and perhaps a profit share) to worry about, but if the shop is closed due to violations, or lawsuit, or lost to a fire, the owner's entire life investment may be lost.

These concerns give rise to the general concept of assurance, which applies to digital business just as it does to small shops.

The following diagram, derived from previous illustrations, shows how this book views assurance: as a set of practices overlaid across the enablers, and in particular concerned with external forces.

Assurance can be seen as an external, additional mechanism of control and feedback;

*Assurance is like out-of-band management*

In terms of the governance-management interface, assurance is fundamentally distinct from the information provided by management and must travel through distinct communication channels. This is why auditors (for example) forward their reports directly to the audit committee, and do not route them through the executives who have been audited.

Technologists, especially those with a background in networking, may have heard of the concept of "out of band control." With out of band management or control of IT resources, the channel over which management commands travel is distinct from the channel over which the system provides its services. This is done to increase security, confidence, and reliability, and is precisely analogous to assurance.

This independent, out-of-band aspect is essential to the concept of assurance. As ISACA stipulates,

_The IS audit and assurance function shall be independent of the area or activity being reviewed to permit objective completion of the audit and assurance engagement._ <<ISACA2014>>, p.9.

anchor:3-party-model[]

====== Three party foundation

[quote, ISAE 3000 (Revised),Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information]
Assurance engagement―An engagement in which a practitioner aims to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence in order to express a conclusion designed to enhance the degree of confidence of the intended users other than the responsible party about the subject matter information (that is, the outcome of the measurement or evaluation of an underlying subject matter against criteria).

[quote, Cobit 5 for Assurance]
Assurance means that, pursuant to an accountability relationship between two or more parties, an IT audit and assurance professional may be engaged to issue a written communication expressing a conclusion about the subject matters to the
accountable party.

There are broader and narrower definitions of assurance. But all reflect some kind of three-party arrangement:

image::images/4.10-3Party.png[]

_reflects concepts from <<ISACA2013b>> and <<IAASB2013>>_

The above diagram is *one* common scenario:

The stakeholder (e.g. the audit committee of the board of directors) engages an assurance professional (e.g. an audit firm). The scope and approach of this is determined by the engaging party, although the accountable party in practice often has input as well.

The accountable party, at the direction responds to  the assurance professional's inquiries on the audit topic.

The assurance professional provides the assessment back to the engaging party, and/or other users of the report (potentially including the accountable party).

This is a simplified view of what can be a more complex process and set of relationships. The ISAE3000 standard states that there must be at least three parties to any assurance engagement:

* The responsible (accountable) party
* The practitioner
* The intended users (of the assurance report)

But there may be additional parties:

* The engaging party
* The measuring/evaluating party (sometimes not the practitioner, who may be called on to render an opinion on someone *else's* measurement)

ISAE3000 goes on to stipulate a complex set of business rules for the allowable relationships between these parties <<IAASB2013>>, pp 95-96. Perhaps the most important rule is that the practitioner *cannot* be the same as either the responsible party, or the intended users. There must be some level of professional objectivity.

====== Types of assurance
[quote, Max Ehrmann, "Desiderata"]
Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery.

The general topic of "assurance" implies a spectrum of activities.

In the strictest definitions, assurance is provided by licensed professionals under highly formalized arrangements. However, *while all audit is assurance, not all assurance is audit.* As noted in COBIT for Assurance, "assurance also covers evaluation activities not governed by internal and/or external audit standards." <<ISACA2013a>> p15.

This is a blurry boundary in practice, as an assurance engagement may be undertaken by auditors, and then might be casually called an "audit" by the parties involved. And there is a spectrum of organizational activities that seem at least to be related to formal assurance:

* Brand assurance
* Quality assurance
* Vendor assurance
* Capability assessments
* Attestation services
* Certification services
* Compliance
* Risk management
* Benchmarking
* Other forms of "due diligence"

Some of these activities may be discharged primarily internally, but even in the case of internally-managed activities, there is usually some sense of governance, some desire for objectivity.

From a purist perspective, internally directed assurance is a contradiction in terms. There is a conflict of interest in that in terms of the three-party model above, the accountable party is the practitioner.

However, it may well be less expensive for an organization to fund and sustain internal assurance capabilities and get much of the same benefits as from external parties. This requires sufficient organizational safeguards be instituted. Internal auditors typically report directly to the Board-level audit committee, and generally are not seen as having a conflict of interest.

In another example, an internal compliance function might report to the corporate general counsel (chief lawyer), and not to any executive whose performance is judged based on their organization's compliance -- this would be a conflict of interest. However, because the internal compliance function is ultimately under the CEO, their concerns can be overruled.

The various ways that internal and external assurance arrangements can work, and can go wrong, is a long history. If you are interested in the topic, review the histories of Enron, Worldcom, the 2008 mortgage crisis, and other such failures.

[quote, James DeLuccia, "Successfully Establishing and Representing DevOps in an Audit"]
Businesses must find a level of trust between each other  . . .  3rd party reports provide that confidence. Those issuing the reports stake their name & liability with each issuance.

Before we turn to a more detailed discussion of audit, we'll discuss some specifically non-audit examples of assurance seen in IT and digital management.

*Example 1: Due diligence on a Cloud provider*

Your company is considering a major move to Cloud infrastructure for its systems. The agility value proposition - the ability to minimize xref:cost-of-delay[Cost of Delay] is compelling, and there may be some cost advantages as well.

But you are aware of some Cloud failures:

* In 2013, UK Cloud provider 2e2 went bankrupt and customers were given "24 to 48 hours to get ... data and systems out and into a new environment" <<duPreez2015>>. Subsequently, the provider demanded nearly £1 million pounds (roughly $1.5 million) from its customers in order for their uninterrupted access to services (i.e., their data.) <<Venkatraman2013>>
* Also in 2013, Cloud storage provider Nirvanix went bankrupt and its customers also had a limited time to remove their data. MegaCloud went out of business with no warning two months later and all customers lost all data. <<Butler2013>>, <<Butler2014>>
* In mid-2014, online source code repository Cloud Spaces (an early Github competitor) was taken over by hackers and destroyed. All data was lost. <<Venezia2014>>, <<Marks2014>>

The question is, how do you manage the risks of trusting your data and organizational operations to a Cloud provider? This is not a new question, as computing has been outsourced to specialist firms for many years. You want to be sure that their operations meet certain standards:

* Financial standards
* Operational standards
* Security standards

Data center evaluations of cloud providers are a form of *assurance*. Two well known approaches are:

* The Uptime Institute's Tier Certification
* The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' (AICPA) SOC 3 "Trust Services Report" certifying "Service Organizations" (based in turn on the SSAE-16 standard)

The Uptime Institute provides the well-known "Tier" concept for certifying data centers, from Tier I to Tier IV. In their words, "Certification provides assurances that there are not shortfalls or weak links anywhere in the data center infrastructure." <<Uptime2016>>. The Tiers progress as follows <<Uptime2014>>:

Tier I: Basic Capacity
Tier II: Redundant Capacity Components
Tier III: Concurrently Maintainable
Tier IV: Fault Tolerance

Uptime Institute certification is clearly a form of assurance in terms of the xref:3-party-model[3-party model]; the data center operator must work with the Uptime Institute who provides an independent opinion based on their criteria as to the data center's tier (and therefore effecctiveness).

The SOC 3 report is considered an "assurance" standard as well. However, as mentioned above, this is the kind of "assurance" done in general by licensed auditors, and which might casually be called an "audit" by the participants. A qualified professional, again in the 3-party model, examines the data center in terms of the SSAE 16 reporting standard. 

*Example 2: Internal process assessment*

*Example 3: Competitive benchmarking*



===== Audit
[quote, Scott Ambler, Disciplined Agile Delivery]
Agile or not, a team ultimately has to meet legal and essential organizational needs, and audits help to ensure this.

Types of audit

* External
* Internal

* Finance
* IT

controls vs enablers

====== External audit

"The Committee therefore recommends that all listed companies should establish an audit committee."  <<Cadbury1992>>, 4.35

An external auditor is chartered by a regulatory authority to visit an
enterprise or entity and to review and independently report the results of that review. <<Moeller2013>> p 319

Phoenix project example

====== Internal audit
[quote, Institute of Internal Auditors]
Internal auditing is an independent appraisal function established within an organization to examine and evaluate its activities as a service to the organization.

Usually reports to audit committee

"The function of the internal auditors is complementary to, but different from, that of the outside auditors." <<Cadbury1992>>, 4.39

the typical internal audit process requires scheduling a review, perform
ing a risk assessment and necessary audit procedures, and then reporting the results
of an audit to management and the audit committee.<<Moeller2013>> p 324
