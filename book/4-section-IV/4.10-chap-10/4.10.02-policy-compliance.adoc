*How policy begins*

Your company was incorporated long ago, but the "board" was always a bit of a joke. The three people who started the company were the directors of record, and they would have an annual "meeting" at the local bar where enough paperwork would be done to satisfy the company lawyer.

Your company did well, and accumulated enough cash to purchase another company, run in much the same way. The people who owned the company being acquired were good, and your company didn't want to lose them, so in addition to senior management positions, they were offered equity -- a share of ownership in the new combined firm.

This raised the topic, "how is the new firm directed?" One of the incoming shareholders wanted a seat on the "board," even though neither company had done much with board-level governance.

The lawyer and accountant hired to assist with the merger also recommended that as part of the acquisition, a formal audit be conducted of both firms (which had never been done).

This audit came back generally clean, but shone a light on differences in how the companies had operated, and unearthed some irregularities.

For example, your company had started to purchase phones for all employees, while the acquired company was pure BYOD (Bring Your Own Device). One company had corporate credit cards, while the other was requiring people to carry their own expenses for reimbursement. One company had an informal "understanding" that first class travel was OK for Asian trips at least, while the other didn't, but neither had written anything down. And so on.

The lawyer said, "I think you need some policies," and everybody groaned. One person said, "I just read about Nordstrom. All they say is "Use Good Judgment." Why do we need anything more?"

The lawyer said, "Um, that's an urban legend. The actual Nordstrom Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, while it starts off with that, runs about 8,000 words and covers a variety of topics such as handling customer information, using technology, social media, and so forth."

And the new CFO said, "Look, I get that we want to stay agile, and keep our informal culture. I'm no fan of policy for the sake of policy. But I need those policies to keep *my* staff costs down. Two different expense approaches doesn't add *any* value to us, and that's only one of twenty issues we've uncovered here. \'Do the right thing' doesn't cut it. We've got to have some means for establishing a baseline with new employees, someplace people can turn to when they don't know what the expectation is."

The HR director chimed in. "If we don't document our official position on things like  harassment we are going to have problems. We could fire someone who has done something really bad, and they could sue us for wrongful termination. Or their victims could sue us for failing to prevent the issue. That could cost us real money." The lawyer nodded and the company owners looked thoughtful.

Another person spoke up. "I came from a company that had a 500-page policy manual. It went down into way too much detail and was always out of date. No-one could find anything in it, and there would be stuff that was wrong because the revision process was broken."

The lawyer said, "You need to keep your policies light and on the general side (like Nordstrom), and cover more detailed topics elsewhere. For example, the exact approach on how to reimburse employee expenses probably doesn't belong in the policy manual. Of course, that means that somewhere you need to lay out how your principles inform your policies which are implemented by processes, procedures, guidelines, and so forth. Your actual employee handbook will probably be thirty or forty pages - sorry. You also should take advantage of your internal intranet and make sure people can find just the policy they need, with related guidance, instead of having to page through a huge document.

"Finally, you need to carefully distribute the authorship and revision control, especially for lower levels of the guidance (e.g. technical standards that can change quickly). This is both because the people most affected should have a stronger voice in the policy, and also because centralized policy groups become bottlenecks if they are doing all the work."

Another said, "This is all getting complicated."

"Yes, complexity is to some extent unavoidable as you move to this new scale. I'm a big fan of sunset dates on policies and supporting materials, so you are periodically questioning whether something is still needed. Of course, this drives demand for someone to analyze and update policies - please don't forget that.

"Overall, you need to always keep your outcomes in mind, and continue to push as much decision making down to individuals as you can. COBIT recognizes that culture is one of the critical xref:enablers[enablers] for governance, and so \'use good judgment' is still a great place to start -- IF you can hire people with good judgment, and continually reinforce them in using it."

===== Mission, principle, strategy, and policy

image:images/4.10-policy.png[]

The above illustration shows one way to think about policy in the context of our overall governance objective of value recognition. Notice the location of the sub-objectives:

* Benefits realization
* Cost optimization
* Risk optimization

The organization's *Mission and vision* should be terse and high level, perhaps something that could fit on a business card. It should express the organization's reason for being in straightforward terms.

The *Principles and codes* should also be brief. ("Codes" can include codes of ethics or codes of conduct.) For example, Nordstrom's is about 8,000 words, perhaps about 10 pages.

[quote, Michael Griffin, "How To Write a Policy Manual"]
Carefully drafted and standardized policies and procedures save the company countless hours of management time. The consistent use and interpretation of such policies, in an evenhanded and fair manner, reduces management's concern about legal issues becoming legal problems.


*Policies* are more extensive. There are various kinds of policies:

In a non-IT example, a compliance policy might identify the Foreign Corrupt Practices act and make it clear that bribery of foreign officials is unacceptable. Similarly, an HR policy might spell out acceptable and unacceptable side jobs (e.g., someone in the banking industry might be forbidden from also being a mortgage broker on their own account).

Policies are often independently maintained documents, perhaps organized along lines similar to:

* Employment and HR policies
* Whistleblower policy (non-retaliation)
* Records retention
* Privacy
* Workplace guidelines
* Travel and expense
* Purchasing and vendor relationships
* Use of enterprise resources
* Information security
* Conflicts of interest
* Regulatory

(not a comprehensive list)

Policies, even though more detailed than codes of ethics/conduct, still should be written fairly broadly. In many organizations, they must be approved by the governing board. *They should therefore be independent of  technology specifics*. An information security policy may state that the hardening guidelines must be followed, but the hardening guidelines (stipulating for example what services and open ports are allowable on Debian Linux) are *not* policy.

There may be various levels or classes of policy.

Finally, policies reference *Standards and processes* and other xref:enablers[enablers] as appropriate. This is the management level, where documentation is specific and actionable. Guidance here may include:

* Standards
* Baselines
* Guidelines
* Processes and procedures

These concepts may vary according to organization, and can become quite detailed.

 examine competing texts for the level they go on this topic in particular

Even more detail is seen in hardening guidelines. A behavioral baseline might be "Guests are expected to sign in and be accompanied when on the data center floor."

We will discuss technical baselines further in the chapter section on security, and also in our discussion of the technology product lifecycle in Chapter 12. See also Shon Harris' excellent CISSP Exam Guide <<Harris2013>> for much more detail on these topics.

The ideal end state is a policy that is completely traceable to various automation characteristics, such as approved "infrastructure as code" settings applied automatically by configuration management software (as discussed in "The DevOps Audit Toolkit," <<DeLuccia2015>>-- more on this to come). However, there will always be organizational concerns that cannot be fully automated in such manners.

[quote, Michael Griffin, "How to Write a Policy Manual"]
Company policies can breed and multiply to a point where they can hinder innovation and risk-taking. Things can get out of hand as people generate policies to respond to one-time infractions or out of the ordinary situations.

Finally, policies and their derivative guidance are developed, just like systems, via a lifecycle. They require some initial vision, and an understanding of what the requirements are. As Steve Schlarman notes, "policy must define the why, what, who, where and how of the IT process" <<Schlarman2008>>.

User stories have been used effectively to understand policy needs. Again, it's advisable to institute sunset dates or some other mechanism that forces their periodic review, with the understanding that any such approach generates demand on the organization that must be funded.

===== Standards, frameworks, methods, and the innovation cycle

We used the term "standards" above without fully defining it.

We have discussed a variety of industry influences throughout this book: PMBOK, ITIL, COBIT, Scrum, Kanban, ISO/IEC 38500 and so on. We need to clarify their roles and positioning further.

All of these can be considered various forms of "guidance" and as such are governance xref:enablers[enablers]. However, their origins, stakeholders, format, content, and usage vary greatly.

First, the term "*standard*" especially has multiple meanings. A "standard" in the policy sense may be a set of compulsory rules. Also, "standard" or "baseline" may refer to some intended or documented state the organization uses as a reference point. An example might be "we run Debian Linux 16.10 as a standard unless there is a compelling business reason to do otherwise."

This last usage shades into a third meaning of standard, normative standards such as are produced by the IEEE, IETF and ISO/IEC.

* ISO/IEC: Internatonal Standards Organization/International Eletrotechnical Commission
* IETF: Internet Engineering Task Force
* IEEE: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers

The International Standards Organization occupies a central place in this ecosystem. It possesses "general consultative status" with the United Nations, and has over 250 technical committees that develop the actual standards.

The IEEE standardizes such matters as wireless networking (e.g. WiFi). The IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) standardizes lower level Internet protocols such as TCP/IP and HTTP. The W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standardizes higher level Internet protocols such as HTML. Sometimes standards are first developed by a group such as the IEEE/IEC and then given further authority though publication by ISO/IEC.

The ISO/IEC in particular, in addition to its technical standards, also develops higher order management/"best practice" standards. One well known example of such an ISO standard is the ISO 9000 series on quality management.

Frameworks were discussed in xref:frameworks[Chapter 9.] Frameworks have two major meanings. First, computing language frameworks are created to make software development easier. Examples include Struts, AngularJS, and many more. This is a highly volatile area of technology, with new frameworks appearing every year and older ones gradually losing favor.

In general we are not concerned with these kinds of specific frameworks in this book, except governing them as part of the xref:tech-prod-lifecycle[technology product lifecycle]. We are concerned with "process" frameworks such as ITIL, PMBOK, COBIT, CMMI, and TOGAF. These frameworks are not "standards" in and of themselves. *However*, they often have corresponding ISO standards:

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|====
|Framework|Standard
|ITIL|ISO/IEC 20000
|COBIT|ISO/IEC 38500
|PMBOK|ISO/IEC 21500
|CMMI |ISO/IEC 15504
|TOGAF |ISO/IEC 42010
|====

Fameworks tend to be lengthy and verbose. The ISO/IEC standards are brief by comparison, perhaps on average 10% of the corresponding framework.

Methods (aka methodologies) in general are more action oriented and prescriptive. Scrum and XP are methods. It is at least arguable that PMBOK is a method as well as a framework.

NOTE: There is little industry consensus on some of these definitional issues and the student is advised to not be overly concerned about such abstract debates.

Finally, there are terms that indicate technology cycles, movements, communities of interest, or cultural trends: Agile and DevOps being two of the most current and notable. These are neither frameworks, standards, nor methods. However, commercial interests often attempt to build frameworks and methods representing these organic trends. Examples include the Scaled Agile Framework, Disciplined Agile Delivery, and many others.

Ultimately, a standardization cycle can be seen:

image::images/4.10-standards-cycle.png[]

Innovations produce value, but innovation presents change management challenges, such as cost and complexity. The natural response is to standardize for efficiency, and standardization taken to its end state results in commodification, where costs are optimized as far as possible and the remaining concern is managing the risk of the commodity (as either consumer or producer). While efficient, commoditized environments offer little competitive value, and so the innovation cycle starts again.

Note that the innovation cycle corresponds to the elements of xref:govarch[value recognition]:

* Innovation corresponds to Benefits Realization
* Standardization corresponds to Cost Optimization
* Commoditization corresponds to Risk Optimization

===== Compliance
[quote, Steve Schlarman]
Policy without a corresponding compliance measurement and monitoring strategy will be looked at as unrealistic, ignored dogma.

discuss how they play out in terms of GRC

Policy is not just about risk. That's why risk comes later. Policy is also about effectiveness, e.g. understanding cost of delay, not overburdening ... we understand risk as risk of loss, not ineffectiveness... but we still control for our policies that are intended to promote effectiveness...

====== Regulations of note
* HIPAA
* SOX
* FERPA
* PCI DSS
* GLBA PII (NIST)

(summarize each of these)

Note that some of these regulations call for policy management.

NOTE: Some companies need to institute formal policies quite early. Even a startup may need written policies, if it is concerned with regulations such as HIPAA. However, this may be done on an ad-hoc basis, perhaps outsourced to a consultant. (A startup cannot afford a dedicated VP of Policy and Compliance.) This topic is covered in detail in this section because at enterprise scale, ongoing policy management and compliance must be formalized.


===== Controls
Management controls are the organization, policies, and procedures used by
agencies to reasonably ensure that
• programs achieve their intended results;
• resources are used consistent with agency mission;
• programs and resources are protected from waste, fraud, and misman
agement;
• laws and regulations are followed; and
• reliable and timely information is obtained, maintained, reported and used
for decision making.-'
