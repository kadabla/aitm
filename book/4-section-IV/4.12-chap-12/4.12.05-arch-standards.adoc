* The _Business Architecture Body of Knowledge_ (BIZBOK), from the Business Architecture Guild <<BAGuild2016>>

NOTE: We previously discussed the Business Analysis Body of Knowledge. Although they have similiar names, BABOK and BIZBOK are distinct in terms of content and their sponsoring organizations.

The Business Architecture Body of Knowledge is a broader, more diverse set of guidance. It defines business architecture as (p.1):

 _"a blueprint of the enterprise that provides a common understanding of the organization and is used to align strategic objectives and tactical demands."_
