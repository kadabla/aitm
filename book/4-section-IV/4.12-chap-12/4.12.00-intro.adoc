==== Introduction to Chapter 12
Portfolio management in terms of information technology means looking at long-lived IT investments in terms of their overall cost, risk, and benefit to the corporation. This can and should be done regardless of whether the IT investment is external or internal facing. Products, services, and applications are the most useful portrfolio constructs, although assets, technology products, and even projects also can figure into longer-horizon value management. Enterprise architecture benefits from a tight alignment with IT portfolio management, as well.


Architecture and governance are two topics that become more important as a company scales up and ages. Decisions that might have been made quickly and casually by a product or project team become more difficult, due to increasingly challenging structural factors both internal and external. Decisions made years ago come back to haunt current strategies with a vengeance. With scale, management needs higher level technical abstractions in order to manage. Architecture provides these, but doing so is difficult and controversial. What happens when management decides to set direction using these same abstractions, and architects find themselves now enforcing what had originally started as mere sense-making?

Vendor relationships become a two-edged sword, providing increased value with access to higher levels of vendor resources, but at the cost of increased lock-in. Pure open-source strategies inevitably become corrupted by business realities.

IMPORTANT: As with other chapters in the later part of this book, we are going to introduce this topic "on its own terms." We will then add additional context and critique in subsequent sections.

 Decide: get more technical in this part as well, as we did in previous?

===== Chapter 12 learning objectives

* Identify the major IT lifecycles and their interactions
* Identify various use cases for IT analytics
** Identify the basic types of IT architecture
* Describe basic architectural practices
* Characterize some typical challenges for architects

_Chapter 11 content to be moved to new file_
Over time, the IT operation develops significant data by which to manage itself. It may develop one or more definitive portfolio list, typically applications, services, assets, and/or technology products. Distinguishing and baselining high quality versions of these data sets can consume inordinate resource, and yet managing the IT organization at scale is nearly impossible without them.. [_didn't want to discuss data per se in the introduction_]


===== Learning objectives

* Identify current approaches to understanding complex systems and their failure modes

* Describe Snowden's Cynefin and its major elements

Process capability is the inherent variation of the process in relation to the specification limits. The smaller the process variation, the better the process's capability. <<Kan1995>>

===== Chapter raw material

*Use of the word "architecture" in information technology*

"Architecture" is of course a word usually associated with physical construction: buildings, landscapes, etc. It was https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture[appropriated by systems engineers at IBM in 1959] to describe the problems of designing complex information processing hardware and software.

This leads to some confusion, and occasional questions from "real" architects as to why IT people are calling themselves "architects." Perhaps a different choice of word would have been advisable.

Because of these facts, it is useful to understand some of the fundamentals of how humans interpret symbolic data.

The true measure of the value of a model is whether it actually influences behavior. Smith/Reinertsen 1998 p46.

Instead of tapping into the existing knowledge of the organization the autonomous team is prone to reinvent the wheel, and the wheel that they reinvent will not always be superior to the one we are currently using. <<Reinertsen1997>> p 104

Flexibility at high levels in the architecture comes from standardization at low levels in the architecture. Paradoxically, structure is the key to freedom. ibid 120

this chapter brings us full circle

developers seeking experience, it is in part how they are compensated. this leads to conflicts over choice of tools. (good blog as well). rational framework for deciding. might go to chapter 8, resource mgmt. intersection between that & tech lifecycle is key.

EA makes the decision to insource or outsource

 - Also important in next chapter, which can be understood as "advanced architecture"

keep EAs off product teams, agree
but they set overall direction @ portfolio level
difficult for them to stay hands on

 Architecture = intersection of technical management with sourcing, information, goveranance

*The folly of letting TLM dominate*

Henrik Kniberg tells the story of one of his most successful projects — a system built for the Swedish police that allowed them to use laptops in the field — and what happened afterwards <<Kniberg2011>>. Because the project was extremely urgent, the group was allowed to use an agile approach and break out of the traditional organizational culture. Everything went well, the police organization viewed it as a success, and the project even won a “project of the year” award.

What came next, however, was even more interesting. A high-level decision was made to rebuild from scratch that same system police had used in the field, using Siebel. This was part of a standardization effort to reduce the complexity and number of systems. Not only was the decision made to use a technology that the development team didn’t agree with, but it was decided to use a more traditional, sequential project-management approach to development. Development took a couple years and when it finally rolled out, it was a disaster because the police found it to be slow and clumsy and basically unusable. Making the change even more difficult was that the police preferred their existing system, which worked. Kniberg estimates that this cost the Swedish police more than £1 billion.

 1 billion pounds ($1.6B) would have bought a lot of support & vendor leverage for the "nonstandard" technologies.
