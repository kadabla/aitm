===== Social, Mobile, Analytics, and Cloud

Discussions of digital transformation often reference the algorithm SMAC:

* Social
* Mobile
* Analytics
* Cloud

Others would add the Internet of Things.

These are not equivalent terms; in fact, they have certain relationships to each other:

Social media is generally external to an organization and manifests as a form of xref:market-data[market data], that provide essential insights into bow a company's products are performing and being received.

Mobile (or mobility) has two distinct aspects: mobility as an engagement platform (e.g. for deployment of "apps" as one product form), versus the xref:market-data[market data] available from mobile carriers, notably geolocation data.

Internet of Things can be either an internal or external data source, often extremely high volume and velocity, requiring analysis services for sense-making and value extraction.

===== Big data

The term "Big Data" in general refers to data that exceeds the traditional data management and data warehousing approaches we have discussed above.
As proposed by analyst Doug Laney in 2001 <<Laney2001>>, its most well known definition identifies 3 dimensions of scale:

* Volume
* Variety
* Velocity

High volume data is seen for example in the search history logs of search engines such as Google.

High variety data encompasses rich media and unstructured data, such as social media interactions.

High velocity data includes telemetry from Internet of Things devices or other sources capable of emitting large volumes of data very quickly.

All of these dimensions require increasingly specialized techniques as they scale, and the data management product ecosystem has continued to diversify as a result.

 ===== EIM applied to digital delivery

 next material is EIM applied to IT, keep but reduce scope/importance somewhat - should still be a major chapter section


Repositories, CMDBs, IT4IT

Analytics and metrics are a related topic for IT management. There are many ways that metrics can be used and misused. A clear understanding of organizational goals is essential to any metrics strategy. Analytics similarly requre an overall framework of continuous improvement so that their insights lead to real actions and value.

* IT analytics
 - grounded in continuous improvement
 - Portfolio and process data
 - The IT data warehouse

  The problem of representation

  Put three people in three rooms

 - one has a pencil & paper
 - one has a box of wooden matches
 - one has two cups, one with a number of marbles in it

  Each room looks out on an arena where horses are being shown. Count the horses.

 ===== EIM Sourcing (the market for data)

  * market data
  * infrastructure


  Package management, CVE, market data

 ===== Metadata and metamodels

  - revisit BORO
  Metadata

  How do you manage data? How do you manage anything? In part, through collecting data about it. Wait - "data about data"? There's a word for that: *metadata*. We'll take some time examining it, and its broader relationships to the digital delivery pipeline.
