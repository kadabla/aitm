Instructor's note:

This is a brief discussion, because many aspects of big data, analytics, and data science are specific forms of product development. This book for example has avoided detailed discussion of programming languages or current vendor products. Similiarly, the intent here is to explore the background and management implications of big data, analytics, and data science, not to discuss specific techniques in any detail.

[quote, Tom Davenport and Jeanne Harris, Competing on Analytics]
...analytical competitors wring every last drop of value from business processes and key decisions.

One important aspect of digital product development is data analytics. Analysis of organizational records has always been a part of any concern large enough to have formal records management. The word for this originally was simply "reporting." A set of files or ledgers would be provided to one or more clerks, who would manually review them and extract the needed figures.

The compilation of data from physical sources, and its analysis for the purposes of organizational strategy, was distinct from the day to day creation and use of the data. The clerk who attended to the customer and updated their account records, had a different role than the clerk who added up the figures across dozens or hundreds of accounts for the annual corporate report.

What do we mean by the words "analysis" or "analytics" in this older context? Just compiling totals and averages was expensive and time-consuming. Cross-tabulating data (e.g. to understand sales by region) was even more so.

As information became more and more automated, the field of "Decision Support" (and its academic partner "Decision Sciences") emerged. The power of extensively computerized information, that could support more and more ambitious forms of analysis, gave rise to the concept and practice of "Data Warehousing" <<Inmon1992>>.

A robust profession and set of practices emerged around data warehousing and analytics. And as infrastructure became more powerful and storage less expensive, the idea of full-lifecycle or closed-loop analytics originated.

When analyzing data is costly and slow, the data analysis can only affect large, long-cycle decisions. It is not a form of fast feedback. The annual report may drive next year's product portfolio investment decisions, but it cannot drive the day to day behavior of sales, marketing, and customer service:

However, as analysis becomes faster and faster, it can inform operational decisions.

And, for certain applications (such as an online traffic management application on your smartphone), analytics is such a fundamental part of the application that it becomes operational. Such pervasive use of analytics is one of the hallmarks of digital transformation.

[quote, Paul Westerman, Data Warehousing: Using the Wal-Mart Model]
The reason to build a data warehouse is to have the ability to make better decisions faster based on information using current and historic data.
