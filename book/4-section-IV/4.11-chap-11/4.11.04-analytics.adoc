Instructor's note:

This is a brief discussion, because many aspects of big data, analytics, and data science are specific forms of product development. This book for example has avoided detailed discussion of programming languages or current vendor products. Similiarly, the intent here is to explore the management implications of big data, analytics, and data science, not to discuss specific techniques in any detail.

[quote, Tom Davenport and Jeanne Harris, Competing on Analytics]
...analytical competitors wring every last drop of value from business processes and key decisions.

One important aspect of digital product development is data analytics. Analysis of organizational records has always been a part of any concern large enough to have formal records management. The word for this originally was simply "reporting." A set of files or ledgers would be provided to one or more clerks, who would manually review them and extract the needed figures.
