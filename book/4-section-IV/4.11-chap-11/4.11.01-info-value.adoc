==== Information and value
[quote, William Kent, Data and Reality]
...life and reality are at bottom amorphous, disordered, contradictory, inconsistent, non-rational, and non-objective. Science and much of Western philosophy have in the past presented us with the illusion that things are otherwise. Rational views of the universe are idealized models that only approximate reality. The approximations are useful. The models are successful often enough in predicting the behavior of things that they provide a useful foundation for science and technology. But they are ultimately only approximations of reality...

[quote, The Data Management Body of Knowedge]
No enterprise can be effective without high quality data.

The two quotes above span the challenge of information management. Fundamentally, it is an illusion. We store data and records that are _representations_. They are merely partial reflections of reality, ambiguous and requiring interpretation.

And yet, these poor shadows of the real world are the basis for all digital business. Despite their limitations, the human race has been representing and recording information in myriad ways for thousands of years.

Suppose someone hands you a piece of paper with the following:

If you are of European descent, you might perceive this as the number twelve, or a count of twelve "somethings." What "somethings"? You don't know.

Someone might tell you that this is the number of trees on your family's farm. That makes all the difference. But wait - you know for a fact that there are many more trees than 12! You inquire further and find out it is actually the number of producing apple trees, a very different concept.

But the number still isn't right; the person who counted the trees didn't know the proper boundaries of your farm and counted a couple of the neighbors' trees, while missing three of yours.

So what does this piece of paper represent? It's a vexing question we will come back to.

===== The origins of digital information
[quote, AncientScripts.com]
Writing provides a way of extending human memory by imprinting information into media less fickle than the human brain.

We've talked of xref:representation[representation] previously, in the context of task management. Understanding representation is fundamental to understanding information.

Humans have been representing information since at least the creation of writing. As early as 3000 BCE, the ancient Sumerians used cuneiform to record -- among other things -- how much beer people got. (The more things change, the more they stay the same.)

Cuneiform was created by pressing wedge-shaped sticks into wet clay. A particular impression or set of impressions corresponded to a citizen, or how much grain they grew, or ... [?]

Certainly, the symbols below are not the same as the beer, or the grain, or the long-dead Sumerian. This may seem obvious, but it can be tempting to confuse the *representation* with the *reality*. (This is known as the _reification fallacy_.)

At around the same time as the Sumerians, the Inca empire in what is now Peru [?] also started to represent information. They used a radically different approach from the Sumerians: carefully knotted ropes:

NOTE: The website http://www.ancientscripts.com/[ancientscripts.com] has a wealth of comprehensive information on the history of writing (and therefore, information management) from its earliest techniques.

We will talk more about *how* information is represented. But first we need to understand *why*.

===== The measurable value of information
[quote, Doug Hubbard, How to Measure Anything]
Measurement: A quantitatively expressed reduction of uncertainty based on one or more observations.

Let's go back to our tree counting problem. Why do we want to count our apple trees?

count neighbors' apple trees b/c we want to buy their orchard

cost of not having the information

if they say, "there are between 80 and 120 trees" and ask 1000 coins... what is information worth?

each tree produces 10 coins per year

so the orchard produces between 100 and 1000 gold pieces a year

you get 50 coins a year just leaving the money with the banker



Well, if we can raise the money, we can purchase some additional land and grow our farm. Selling the trees is one way to raise money.

And -- this is the important point -- not only do the trees have value, but knowing how many we have also has value. If we have enough trees, we can make the investment in cutting them down

Expected value of perfect information

What is the decision this measurement is supposed to support?
2. What is the definition of the thing being measured in terms of observable consequences?
3. How, exactly, does this thing matter to the decision being asked?
4. How much do you know about it now (i.e., what is your current level of uncertainty)?
5. What is the value of additional information?

===== Information and efficiency

IT doesn't matter - efficiency

===== Information and effectiveness
[quote, Tom Davenport and Jeanne Harris, Competing on Analytics]
At a time when companies in many industries offer similar products and use comparable technology, high-performance business processes are among the last remaining points of differentiation. Many of the previous bases for competition are no longer available. Unique geographical advantage doesn't matter in global competition, and protective regulation is largely gone. Proprietary technologies are rapidly copied, and breakthrough innovation in products or services seems increasingly difficult to achieve. What's left as a basis for competition is to execute your business with maximum efficiency and effectiveness, and to make the smartest business decisions possible. And analytical competitors wring every last drop of value from business processes and key decisions.
