==== Information and value
[quote, William Kent, Data and Reality]
...life and reality are at bottom amorphous, disordered, contradictory, inconsistent, non-rational, and non-objective. Science and much of Western philosophy have in the past presented us with the illusion that things are otherwise. Rational views of the universe are idealized models that only approximate reality. The approximations are useful. The models are successful often enough in predicting the behavior of things that they provide a useful foundation for science and technology. But they are ultimately only approximations of reality...

No enterprise can be effective without high quality data.


===== The origins of digital information
[quote, AncientScripts.com]
Writing provides a way of extending human memory by imprinting information into media less fickle than the human brain.

We've talked of xref:representation[representation] previously, in the context of task management. Understanding representation is fundamental to understanding information.

===== Information and efficiency

IT doesn't matter - efficiency

===== Information and effectiveness
[quote, Tom Davenport and Jeanne Harris, Competing on Analytics]
At a time when companies in many industries offer similar products and use comparable technology, high-performance business processes are among the last remaining points of differentiation. Many of the previous bases for competition are no longer available. Unique geographical advantage doesn't matter in global competition, and protective regulation is largely gone. Proprietary technologies are rapidly copied, and breakthrough innovation in products or services seems increasingly difficult to achieve. What's left as a basis for competition is to execute your business with maximum efficiency and effectiveness, and to make the smartest business decisions possible. And analytical competitors wring every last drop of value from business processes and key decisions.
