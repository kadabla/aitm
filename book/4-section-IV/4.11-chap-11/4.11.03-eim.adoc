==== Towards enterprise information management

The previous chapter was necessary, but narrow. From those basic tools of defining controlled vocabularies and mapping them onto computing platforms, has come today's digital economy and its exabytes of data.

The relational database as represented in the previous chapter can scale, as a single unit, to surprising volumes and complexity. Perhaps the most sophisticated and large scale examples are seen in Enterprise Resource Planning (more detail on this in the Topics section.) An ERP system can manage the supply chain, financials, human resources, and manufacturing operations for a Fortune 50 corporation, and itself constitute terabytes and tens of thousands of tables.

However, ERP vendors do not sell solutions for leading edge digital transformation. They represent the commoditization side of the xref:innovation-cycle[Innovation Cycle]. One cannot base a digital go-to-market strategy on them, as everyone has them.

Competing in the market requires systems of greater originality and flexibility, and that usually means some commitment to either developing them with internal staff or partnering closely with someone who has the necessary skills.

And as these unique systems scale up, a variety of concerns emerge, requiring specialized perspectives and practices.

===== Advanced data management
The previous chapter section gave us the basics of data storage. We turn to some of the emergent practices seen as enterprise information management scales up:

* Reference data management
* Master data management and The "System of Record"
* Data quality management

====== Data integration and the "System of Record"

In the last section, we analyzed a business problem as a data model and created a simple database. Notice that if data is NOT in a table in the database, the database doesn't know about it. Therefore, if there is data held in other parts of the company, it must be loaded into the database before it can be combined with that database's other data. This can also apply to data held by Cloud providers.

Let's go back to our xref:0.01-emergence[emergence model]. Think about moving from one database, to two.

In the example below, the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system is in the cloud, and data is also being imported from the product database:

The process of identifying such remote data and loading it into a database to enable work to be done is known as "integration" and is a complex domain. There are many ways data can be integrated, and industry views of what is "good practice" have changed over the years. Take the above diagram and multiply it by several hundred times, and you will start to get an idea of the complexity of enterprise information management at scale in the enterprise.

NOTE: Thinking in terms of the emergence model, you have likely been integrating data in various ways for some time. However, in a large governed organization, you need to formalize your understandings and approach. More on this in the next chapter section.

====== Reference data management
[quote, Malcolm Chisholm, Managing Reference Data]
Reference data is any kind of data that is used solely to categorize other data found in a database, or solely for relating data in a database to information beyond the boundaries of the enterprise.

There are various ways to categorize data. Frequently, it is categorized by business process or functional area (Sales, Marketing, Support, etc). However, another important way to understand data is by its non-functional characteristics. Some data is transactional (e.g. Invoice and Invoice Line Item in the above example) and some is more persistent (Customer, Product).

When data is highly persistent and used for primarily for categorizing across an enterprise, we may call it  "reference" data. Classic examples of reference data include:

* Geographic information (cities, states, zip codes)
* Widely used "codes" in the business (medical insurance makes extensive use of these)
* An organization's chart of accounts



Reference data is among the first data to be shared between systems.

====== Data quality

data warehousing

definitions/designs
conceptual/logical/physical schema
Metadata

How do you manage data? How do you manage anything? In part, through collecting data about it. Wait - "data about data"? There's a word for that: *metadata*. We'll take some time examining it, and its broader relationships to the digital delivery pipeline.

====== Information related risks
We've discussed the simple 4-tier info sensitivity model (backref). A comprehensive information classification model must accommodate:

* sensitivity
* regulatory
* records

that is, data is a black box tagged with "Public" or "Top Secret" or some such or purely instrumental like "SOX" or "HIPAA" vs understanding the MEANING - e.g. "patient history" or "audit findings"
