==== Introducing Scrum

[quote, Chris Sims/Hillary L. Johnson, Scrum: A Breathtakingly Brief and Agile Introduction]
Scrum is a lightweight framework designed to help small, close-knit teams of people develop complex products.

[quote, Jeff Sutherland, Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time]
There Are No Tasks; There Are Only Stories.

One of the first Agile methodologies you are likely to encounter as a practitioner is Scrum. There are many books, classes, and websites where you can learn more about this framework; <<Sims2012>> is a good introduction.

We mention Scrum in this chapter, as it is very product-focused. It calls for the roles of:

* Product owner
* Scrum master
* Team member

and avoids further elaboration of roles.

The Scrum product owner is responsible for holding the product vision and seeing that the team executes the highest value work. To do this, the potential features for the product are maintained in a "backlog" that can be re-prioritized as necessary (rather than a large, fixed-scope project). The product owner also defines acceptance criteria for the backlog items.

The Scrum Master, on the other hand, acts as a team coach, "guiding the team to ever-higher levels of cohesiveness, self-organization, and performance." <<Sims2012>>.

Scrum uses specific practices and artifacts such as sprints, standups, reviews, the above-mentioned concept of backlog, burndown charts, and so forth. We will discuss these in Chapter 5 (Work Management) along with Kanban, another popular approach for executing work.

* There are three roles:
** The product owner sets overall direction.
** The Scrum Master coaches and advocates for the team
** The development team is defined as those who are committed to the development work
* There are various artifacts:
** Product backlog is the overall “to-do” list for the product. (More on product management in the next chapter.)
** Sprint backlog is the to-do list for the current sprint
** Potentially shippable product increment is an important concept used to decouple the team’s development activity from downstream business planning. A PSI is a cohesive unit of functionality that *could* be delivered to the customer, but doing so is the decision of the product owner.
* There are seven activities:
** The “sprint” is a defined time period, typically two to four weeks, in which the development team executes on an agreed scope
** Backlog grooming is when the product backlog is examined and refined into increments that can be moved into the sprint backlog
** Sprint Planning is where the scope is agreed
** The Daily Scrum is traditionally held standing up, to maintain focus and ensure brevity
** Sprint Execution is the development activity within the sprint
** Sprint Review is the “public end of the sprint” when the stakeholders are invited to view the completed work
** The Sprint Retrospective is held to identify lessons learned from the sprint and how to apply them in future work.

 elaborate considerably - not difficult

  The theory of Scrum. Why Scrum works..

   * high bandwidth
   * queue management
   * minimize multi-tasking (human factors)
   * etc
