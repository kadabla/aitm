=== Chapter 4: Product Management

==== Introduction to Chapter 4

****
*Product Management?*

"Product management?" In a book on IT management? Those of you with industry experience, especially backgrounds in project-based enterprise software development, may be unfamiliar with the term. However, a focus on product development is one of the distinguishing features of Agile development, even if that development is taking place in a larger enterprise context.

As you grow your company, you are bringing more people in. You become concerned that they need to share the same vision that inspired you to create this company. This is the goal of product management.

Product strategy was largely tacit in Section I. Now you need more formalized approaches to defining, communicating, executing.

Furthermore, while we covered Agile principles and practices in some detail last chapter, we did not discuss *why* they work. In this chapter, we will cover the Lean theory of product management that provides a basis for Agile practices, in particular the work of Don Reinertsen.
