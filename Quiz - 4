Hello Mr. Charles,

Could we please elaborate on the question about the Tools we are using in our labs:
Example question:
* what Tool are we using in Lab:
Junit
Tomcat
Java
Ant
Shell

I know  for sure we are using Ant, Shell, Tomcat JUnit. 
I picked ant, went back to select shell and submitted and got it wrong.
